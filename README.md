# Description

Recognize the spam email using Machine Learning by `sklearn` and `pandas`.

This project implements a simple email filter, which recognize the spam and ham emails.

The modes uses `RandomForestClassifier` to classify the emails.

# How to use

If you want to run the Jupyter Notebook on your own machine, you can clone files and run it. But note that I run it by `python 3.8.2`, `pandas 1.0.1` and `sklearn 0.23.0` on `MacOS 10.15.4`. I didnâ€™t test it on other versions.

Alternatively, you can run it using Microsoft Azure Notebooks by https://notebooks.azure.com/cche7346/projects/spam-recognization
